As I look at piece number [107/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975658931087474689 "Image 107/1924 in the 1924 Pieces of me Collection on Opensea") (also known as _Position 3, Colour Scheme_) I see the face of dog, perhaps a pug or bulldog gazing back at me. From different angle I see a guant, elongated, skeletal face gazing back at me from dark, cavernous, eyes. Perhaps, I see the skull of ~diseased~ deceased warrior in a viking helmet, complete with a spike. One minute a gholish warrior, one minute a dog. These changes are perhaps a metaphor for the way in which our perception of our imagined self changes with observation? I wonder. Gazing in to the eyes of the skull like face, I suddenly see two robed figures, faceless, and knelt in prayer. Have I found my desperation hidden in plain sight within the image in these two annonymous monastic individuals?

"Not much", says my son (aged 11), when I ask him what he sees in this one. "I kind of see a map" says my daughter (aged 9) as she looks on. "These are the planets, these are the rivers in between? ..."this area is extra sandy" she continues. I think she meant islands, rather than planets but who am I to correct her thinking? 

As I look at the "sandy area" she pointed to, I wonder if I can see two hippopotamuses dreaming at a monochrome waterhole.

Piece number [148/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975704011064213505 "Image 148/1924 of the 1924 Pieces of Me Collection") (also known as _Position 3, Colour Scheme 44_) shows the pug's floppy eared face (to me) in a starker relief. Its mouth hangs open a little. I wonder if in fact it is the pug wearing the spiked helmet in this incarnation. My mind recalls the transformation of Cringer to Battle Cat in the He-Man cartoons of my youth, and the more recent sequel. His armour (and helmet) became a symbol of his transformation from "coward" to "brave". I suppose I had already had memories of the villanous Skeletor in the earlier gaunt skull face. Do we all have armour hidden within us? Certainly, I recognise the sense of fear. Lost again in the image: I notice the hippos drinking at the oasis.
