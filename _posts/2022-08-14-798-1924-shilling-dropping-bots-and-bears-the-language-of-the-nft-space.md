title: '798/1924, Shilling, Dropping, Bots and Bears: The Language of the NFT Space '
---
As of a couple of days ago [fifty percent of _Me_ is live (for sale) on Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/1924piecesofme "1924 Pieces of Me collection on Opensea"), thats is to say that pieces 1/1924 to 962/1924 have been "minted" and listed for sale. They should appear in order but, to be honest, I am only human so their are a few errors in the number order. The human touch is important throughout this project both in terms of content, practice, praxis and process. 

I considered programming my own _"smart contract"_ to manage the the process, but this carried an upfront cost in _"gas fees"_ which I could not afford. Also, it seemed important to do the labour of creation and implementation myself. This may seem an unusual choice when working in the Web 3.0 enabled space of Non-fungible Token (NFT) based art where a huge number of "sucessful" projects are iterative in nature and/or constructed by algorythms. Indeed, given that the process presses certain of my neurodiversity and disability buttons, I was possibly more prone to mistakes and definitly more likely to be slower than the average bear (to paraphrase Yogi Bear for no particular reason). "You know you could download a free bot to do that?" piped up my son (19), as I sat cursing quietly to myself after making a mistake that required hours of unpicking. I haven't googled to see if he is correct, although I am reasonably sure I could subcontract it out to another human, if not to an bot or some other form of automatation. 

The majority of "marketing" for NFTs seems to take place in the Web 2.0 space (e.g. what's now considered to be _traditional_ social media) with, as far as I can tell, twitter being the platform of choice for creators and collectors to interact. "Who's going to want to buy pictures of your brain anyway?" says my son (13). That's not a bad question? I wonder who will? I suppose I am hoping that I can create interest in the philosophical issues I am trying to raise with the project that _"collectors"_ will buy in to that narrative. However, I wonder if the space is ready for questions and debates about _identity, ownership, disability, mental health and vulnerability_? I remember, not for the first time, that I was warned by those operating outside the NFT and blockchain space that they felt like it would not be a safe place for this kind of project. I continue to hope that I can disprove that.

I have spent the weekend actively engaging with the twitter-based world of NFT collecters and creators (so much so that I have had to resist the urge to insert a series of hashtags here and there as I write). It is a strange place full of bots and automated messages (which seems hardly suprising given the nature of the beast. I have been _"shilling"_ and _"dropping"_ my artwork as best I can, the calls for it are endless. But no one has bitten yet, perhaps my artwork is not aesthetically pleasing or my price too high. Who knows, it remains early days for the project.

My son (19), apparently the fountain of all knowledge, tells me that I should have "created hype" before releasing the images for sale. However, it seemed to me that the images needed to be in exististance before I could have the discussions I wanted to have, and indeed now they do "exist" as NFTs they have taken on a strange tangible quality that is some how different to the original images from which they are created. That is, of course, ridiculous to say as they are intangible and ephemeral by their very nature. However, they seem to be somehow more concrete once listed for sale than they are were when I curated and aranged them in to the silent video, for example. Each image is fixed, perhaps by the signing of the token at the point of listing (the confirmation of the _minting_ in the blockchain). That being said, the creation of the video brings the images to life for me; a friend tells me "the artwork is meditative, silence worked perfectly". Of course, the images themselves fix a moment of my life in time. From live subject to fixed image to digital immortality in the blockchain, a snapshot of a life. 

And so my mind returns to the language of the space I recently come to inhabit. My twitter feed is full of, repeated, calls to _"shill"_ or _"drop"_ your nfts for sale. The implication being that semi-immediate purchase or promotion will follow...and there follows hundreds of posts of images from creators hungry for a sale. Aren't we all. I feel uneasy responding to the calls to _"shill"_ as the word seems disingenous as a term of art, I feel that it has a sense of dishonesty within its regular meaning. A quick reference to the dictionary confirms my thinking. As a noun the word (according to the Oxford Languages Dictionary that powers Google definitions) means: _"an accomplice of a confidence trickster or swindler who poses as a genuine customer to entice or encourage others"_ and the corresponding verb means to _"act or work as a shill"_. I can not help but wonder how the adoption of a phrase that implies dishonesty has affected the development of attitudes within the space. Is it simply assumed that noone is what or who they seem? Where does that leave a project which is intrinsically tied to my identity and personhood albeit under the sobriquet of The Artist Embodied?

My response is to share details of the project on these posts with commentary about the issues we hope to raise, and a selected Piece of Me for their consideration. I wonder if I would have more success if I just posted the image without commentary, but it feels important to be as authentic as possible. The discussion is part of the art and part of the point(?). 

![Screenshot showing nothing but drops requests]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Drop list tweet.PNG)

The other word that is used a lot in these posts is _"drop"_ which conjours a sense of abandonment: "let your art fall here and walk away". Each call for _shills_ or _drops_ gets hundreds of replies, and it seems likely that my comments will be lost in the noise. That being said I have been pleased to see a couple of likes and retweets from outside of the NFT space. Where possible, I try to respond to clues in the _collector's_ post or twitter handle, and tailor my commentary towards them. This is of course impossible for the majority of accounts that follow a boilerplate "Drop/Shill your NFT here" format, but there are occiaisions where it is possible. For example, when [replying to NFT Freak](https://twitter.com/1924_me/status/1558371127323463681?s=21&t=-Uq0UnWhigE3Au6OtReOkA "Reply to NFT Freak") I was reminded of the many occaisions I had faced name calling and other forms of anti-social behaviour in my life. I asked: 

	What does it mean to be called a #freak? Or #weird? Or #eccentric?
    
This question had been on my mind a lot because of the time of year. The 11th of August is the anneversary of the murder of Sophie Lancaster. Sophie was killed in what was a de facto hate crime against her (and her partner) because they were "different". What did Sophie do to attract fatal abuse from her attackers?: nothing except follow her passions and be comfortable with herself. Perhaps you might say she was "a goth" [The Sophie Lancaster Foundation website explains](https://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com/ "Link to the Sophie Lancaster foundation"):

	_She and her boyfriend were creative, artistic people who dressed in their own unique way. 		They were attacked by a gang of five boys in a park in Bacup, Lancashire on 11 August 2007. 	The gang attacked Sophieâ€™s boyfriend first and then turned on her, carrying out a brutal and 	sustained attack._ 
    
I was fortunate to work with Sophie's mother, Sylvia, at various points over the last 15 years as she campaigned tirelessly to stop the same thing happening to other people. [Sylvia Lancaster](https://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com/dr-sylvia-lancaster-obe-love-and-light/ "Link to Sylvia Lancaster obituary") sadly passed away earlier this year, and will be sadly missed. If you ever get to hear [_Black Roses_](https://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com/black-roses/ "Link to details about Black Roses") the poetic docu-drama by Simon Armitage: take that chance.

So I continue to engage with the NTF twitter-verse in as authentic away as possible. I suppose, thay this is one of those tasks I could automate or delegate but again it feels important to do it myself and to keep it is as responsive as possible. I am hesitent even to cut and paste, trying to make each response unique. Trying to avoid the appearance of being a _bot_.
