The first Piece of Me presented in the collection is [1/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975542382854930433 "Link to 1/1924 on Opensea") and I have decided to take a moment to reflect on what I see in the image and share my free associations from it.

At first glance: I see two horses heads (back to back), I see a cartoon bear with a smirk on his face, I see a sad mouth. Taken as a whole: I see almost the face of dog or a particularly scary clown, perhaps a clown mask. 

I asked my son (aged 11) what he could see. He replied: "I saw a bear, a polar bear I think. I saw a little baby lizard, like a head and a body. Maybe a big lizard too. Thatâ€™s all I see, just a polar bear and lizards."

Looking where he points, I don't see the lizard. As I look again it takes shape. Or is it a fish head that I see? Suddenly, the obvious curves of a chameleon's head, with obligatory bulging eyes, take shape as I gaze forward more.

A friend "loves the mouse head in the middle", and can not shake the dominating image of "a phallus" in the picture. I assume she means the protuberance at the top, but I forgot to ask. I find myself lost in the image as I look for meaning in the interplay of shapes, colours and structures in the image.

1/1924 is also known _Position 1, Colour Scheme 1_ and is unique in its construction. The next 51 images in the collection share the same Position as its base architecture. However, the same moment in time shared through different lenses creates a different focus in each image. Just as I see things differently from my friend or my child.

Piece of Me [26/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975569870645624833 "Linke to 26/1924 on Opensea") (also known as _Position 1, Colour Scheme 26_) uses quite a different pallette and whilst the bear's face (or is it a mouse) seems to be highlighted, other things seem to have faded in the sea of red. As I look: I see the image of a small turtle form. I wipe my screen and the turtle, disappears, a speck of dust had changed what I saw. Where the turtle had formed for a moment a family of rats takes its place and spreads around the space. I find myself lost in the image once again.
