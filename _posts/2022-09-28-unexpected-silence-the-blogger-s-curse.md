## The Difficulty of a Blog-Life Balance When Disabled

When I started this blog, I intended to write daily and among other things: 

- Chart the progress of the the 1924 Pieces of Me project; 
- Explore the 1924 Pieces of Me project;
- Discuss issues of disability, mental health and social barriers;
- Record my lived experience of disability, mental health and social barriers;
- Discuss my experiences in Web 3.0, NFTs and the crypto space.
- Talk about anything I thought was interesting.

And since mid-August, I have used this blog to do precisely none of those things. A number of aphorisms spring to mind, including: "the best laid plans of mice and men" and "the road to hell is pathed with good intentions". Despite my lack of writing I haven't been idle.
