In my free associative thoughts and reflections on Piece of Me number [54/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975600656971202561 "Image 54/1924") from the [1924 Pieces of Me Collection](www.1924piecesofme.com "Collection on Opensea") (also known as _Position 2, Colour Scheme 2_) I realise the bear has become angry, and partly obscured by a cloud. Or perhaps it is shouting? Then I think I see a volcano where others might see a phallus? Did I see a volcano in the images in [Position 1](https://1924piecesofme.com/2022/08/09/1-1924.html "Blog on Position 1") too? I glance at the [collection and briefly review the images in position 1](https://opensea.io/collection/1924piecesofme?search[sortAscending]=true&search[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Position&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=1 "Opensea filtered by position 1"), it definitely seems the volcano is clearer here in [Position 2](https://opensea.io/collection/1924piecesofme?search[sortAscending]=true&search[sortBy]=UNIT_PRICE&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Position&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=2 "Opensea Collection filtered by Position 2"). The same moment in time, seen differently from a different perspective and through a different lens. It just seems different.
I see two horses' heads emerge again, one clearer than the other, and elsewhere the thorax and mandible of a giant ant take shape.

Moving to [101/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975652334017708033 "Image 101/1924 on Opensea") (Position 2, Colour Scheme 49) I realise the volcano seems clearer still in the fiery tones of this colour scheme. I see a tiny octopus, I see the details of a horse's mane and I wonder if I can see the outline of a tiny primate and decide for certain that I can see the face of a fox. Of course the bear remains angry. I wonder where my own anger and frustration are captured in this image, and the collection as a whole? 

The outline of the tiny primate, that I decide now I can certainly see, is a golden taramin monkey. It has been brought to life in the colours and is now impossible to unsee.
