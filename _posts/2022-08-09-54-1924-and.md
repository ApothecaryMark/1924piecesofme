In my free associative thoughts and reflections on Piece of Me number [54/1924](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/64162533542198579898252916190583583845604629893829087458582975600656971202561 "Image 54/1924") from the [1924 Pieces of Me Collection](www.1924piecesofme.com "Collection on Opensea") (also known as _Position 2, Colour Scheme 2_) I realise the bear has become angry, and partly obscured by a cloud. Or perhaps it is shouting? Then I think I see a volcano where others might see a phallus? Did I see a volcano in the images in [Position 1](https://1924piecesofme.com/2022/08/09/1-1924.html "Blog on Position 1") too? I glance at the [Collection and the images of Position 1 (https://opensea.io/collection/1924piecesofme?search[sortAscending]=true&search[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Position&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=1 "Position 1 Filter on Opensea")
